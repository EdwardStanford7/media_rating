This is an app to rank anything you want but I personally use it to rank books, movies, tv shows, and video games.

How to use:
- App will create a spreadsheet for you if you want to build it from the ground up inside the app.
- If you want to make the spreadsheet yourself, spreadsheet needs to have category headings in the first row with items listed in order below each heading in the same column.
- If you make your own spreadsheet then first time you open the spreadsheet it will take a really long time because it will be searching google for images to pair with all the items in your spreadsheet.
- App will create an images directory in the same directory the xlsx file is in to cache images so that the next time you run the app it doesn't take nearly as long.
