I like to rate media I consume based on a ranking system of 1-7. This is just a little CLI app to make the ratings more accurate by using an elo system and then splitting into ratings based on a normal distribution.

How to use:
- Spreadsheet needs to have category headings in the first row and ratings in the column directly next to the entries.
- The first time you run the app it will take a really long time because it will be searching google for images to pair with all the items in your spreadsheet.
- App will create an images directory in the same directory the xlsx file is in to cache images so that the next time you run the app it doesn't take nearly as long.
